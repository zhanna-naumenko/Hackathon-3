Data Cleaning
You demonstrated a great effort in cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, removing duplicates and converting date columns to datetime objects. Great job with this.
Grade: 17/20

Feature Engineering
Excellent efforts in engineering new features, such as creating a feature for days a user has been on Twitter. Additionally, cleaning and preprocessing the user names and descriptions before applying TF-IDF vectorization were good moves. As well as classifying the usernames by Person or Organizattion. Great work!
Grade: 18/20

Data Analysis
Your data analysis was well-executed with clear and informative plots. You did a great job in identifying trends, such as the surge in account creation during specific months and the correlation between tweet counts and retweets.Great work. Bravo
Grade: 18/20

Concluded Insights
Amazing job articulating the conclusions and findings you made. The insights about the activity patterns of health providers and the correlation between tweet sentiment and retweet counts were particularly insightful. 
Grade: 18/20

Use of Machine Learning:
Great job applying various machine learning techniques effectively, from TF-IDF vectorization to K-means clustering and SVM classification.
The comparison between the initial and cleaned data, and the improvement in silhouette scores, showcased your understanding of the importance of data preprocessing. 
The use of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and sentiment analysis using VADER were excellent choices for extracting more insights from the text data. 
Trying more advanced models or hyperparameter tuning for the SVM classifier would further strengthen your machine learning approach.
